### Introduction

Revealed at Retro Fusion 08 and demonstrated a year later at Byte Back, _Repton: The Lost Realms_ is a long-lost BBC Micro sequel to _Repton 3_. After the launch of _Repton Infinity_, it was re-developed into _Cyroid-X_, but never released. After discovering some unfixable bugs due to a lack of source code, Tom Walker has reimplemented the core engine, creating arguably the best Repton engine for the BBC Micro. An Electron port including a Plus 3 enhanced version is also in development. Four levelsets of six screens have been completed by a host of talented _Repton_ famous faces - contributors include the author of _Repton 3_, Matthew Atkinson, Superior Software head honcho Richard Hanson, PC _Repton_ level designers, Michael S and Jonathan P as well as other RS team members. In addition, Retro Software's graphical supremo [Dave Jeffery](http://kecskebak.blogspot.com/2010/11/designing-reptons-lost-realms.html) has given the new game a complete, but traditional, graphical overhaul. The game was finally completed and launched with kind permission of [Superior Interactive](http://www.superiorinteractive.com/) on November 6th/7th at the huge R3PLAY gaming show in Blackpool. See the forum below for the latest information.
