Game Editor:
Basically each screen is made up of 220 blocks (11\*20). Each bit in a byte represents 1 block, so each screen requires 28 bytes. But with only one block type per screen. Then I’m allowing another 9 btyes for each screen for various things, I.e block sets and pallet colour switching, screen flipping etc. Basically I will design each screen using a single base block then hopefully ‘grow’ the rest of the screen using random techniques to place ladders, corner tiles ropes etc. Then place keys and locks and moving platforms in after. The screenshots below were created like this. If I don’t get good results I will go back to a standard two blocks per byte.
Offers of Help:
During the later stages, would anybody like to design a loading screen and game music/sounds?
