===Introduction===

Legendary text adventure developer, _Infocom_, designed their games to run as a virtual machine, known as a [Z-Machine](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-machine_(interpreter)>). This meant that all of the company's interactive fiction games could be ported to a new platform by simply porting the underlying Z-Machine Interpreter. Infocom never officially released a port of their games to the BBC Micro, though they were rumoured to have created a prototype interpreter which was abandoned due to concerns about potential software piracy. In the '90s, fans reverse-engineered the Z-Machine format and have ported the Z-Machine Interpreter to many new platforms including mobile phones, hand-held consoles and PDAs. A new language, [Inform](http://www.inform-fiction.org/), was also created for designing new adventures which could be complied into the Z-machine format.

This project aims to port the Z-Machine Interpreter to the BBC Micro, allowing you to run most of the non-graphical Infocom back-catalogue of games, as well as many modern adventures created with Inform. Inform 6 can also be used to write your own v3 games which can then be played on the BBC Micro.
