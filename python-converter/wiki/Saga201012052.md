# 05/12/2010: A Quick Mock-up

![](./images/sagamockup.png "fig:sagamockup.png") I started messing with translating the original Mysterious Adventures graphics across to the BBC. This is relatively simple, the format has already been described by me at [Adventure International Memorial](http://aimemorial.if-legends.org/gfxldp.html). It is basically a selection of moves, draws and flood fills. This is almost trivial to implement on a Master (as there's a built in flood fill in MOS). There may be a tad more fun on the BBC.

Normally to convert from the Spectrum graphics to the BBC plot co-ordinates we'd multiply the co-ordinates by 4, which'd fill half the screen with the graphic. I wondered whether it'd be easier to multiply by 2 and have a smaller image and use this as a header. The image attached is a mockup, written in BASIC which plots the first screen, then uses text windows to place the text in appropriate places to maximise use of the screen. The screen is mode 1 and the BASIC program will only work on the Master (due to the aforementioned flood fill), but I thought it'd show how much better we can be than the other computers!
