### Introduction

![](./images/Electron Chuckie Egg cover.jpg) The classic platformer *[Chuckie Egg](wikipedia:Chuckie_Egg "wikilink")* was originally released on the Spectrum, the Dragon 32 and the BBC Micro in 1983 by A&F Software, based on an original idea from the Spectrum author, Nigel Alderton. The BBC Micro version by Doug Anderson was especially popular in schools around the country and two years later was ported by him, with some colour limitation, to the Acorn Electron. Faithful fan ports to the Archimedes and Risc PC followed, leaving the Atom as the last Acorn home computer to have not yet received a port of *Chuckie Egg*.

Retro Software is therefore proud to reveal a brand new Atom port by talented coder Kees van Oss, which was first showcased at the *[In Da 80s](http://inda80s.cgeu.info/)* show in Manchester, July 2011. Designed with input from the professionals behind *[The Chuckie Egg Professional's Resource Kit](http://www.bagshot-row.org/chuckie-egg/)*, this new release is an astonishingly accurate version of the beloved title. The striking background colour aside, the sprites are identical to its bigger Acorn sibling ports and the unique physics that made the original versions stand apart is reproduced here without any compromise. The level designs have been reduced slightly to fit the Atom's smaller MODE resolution, which results in a tighter, faster game - arguably, this release is even more challenging than both the BBC Micro and Electron ports. Even more surprising is the quality of the sound effects that have been achieved, given the Atom's limited sound capabilities.
