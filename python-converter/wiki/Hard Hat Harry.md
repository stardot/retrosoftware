### Introduction

"Hard Hat Harry" is a platform game. Unlike my other games, this is a 'quickie' - the planned finishing date is the 26th January 2011, the day uni starts again. In order to do this, the design is deliberately limited - it's intended to resemble a release from 1983, complete with terrible programmer graphics.

<tt>HARD HAT HARRY

From Really-up-to-date Software in Autumn 1983

An action filled arcade game for the BBC Micro model B

Edwards & Co is in charge of building the RS Tower. 20 stories high, it will dominate the sky of the Midlands. Only problem is, they built it next to the zoo. Which has had a breakout and all the animals have escaped. Naturally, seeing a big object right next to where they were, they've occupied the RS Tower.

Now, the construction workers won't stand for this sort of thing. They're ready to take action - once they've had lunch, that is. Which as ever, involves tea. Unfortunately the animals have stolen all their tea and they'll have to get them back. Even more unfortunately, it looks like they'll have to get it back themselves...

Wait! What about the work experience kid?

Entering HARD HAT HARRY.

15 years old, and working towards a B in O-level French, Harry is the ideal candidate for this deadly mission. But the stakes couldn't be higher. Succeed, and he'll get a good reference and become a banker or something. Fail, and the workers (including foreman Mr. Moore) will rivet gun him to the tower and sod off down the pub.

Enemies he'll encounter :

Monkeys - these mischevious creatures have stolen all the tools and are throwing them around. No-one knows why they're so violent. Maybe it's because of the kid who broke in the other day when they were sleeping and painted them all purple.

Birds - half of these aren't even from the zoo, they're just opportunists. Rats of the sky.

Big Kong - Big Kong dreams of climbing the Empire State building and being shot at by planes. Harry would prefer that - at least then Kong wouldn't be his problem.

Peter the Panda - A rare attraction at the zoo, Peter the Panda sits around eating bamboo all day. Not much has changed now he's on the tower. No wonder them pandas are nearly extinct.

Items he'll encounter :

Mugs - Harry needs to collect all the mugs of tea on each floor

Conveyers - The height of technology, the conveyor belts move objects and Harry around. Sometimes they even work.

Stripey Paint - This elusive object grants Harry invincibility and impressive skills with the opposite sex. Or at least that's what the workers tell him.</tt>
