### The Plot

Markie is in the pub at Retrovision, about to tuck into the pub's last mixed grill. When comic book supervillain Mixed Grill Man (aka Bane) realises that the pub has no more mixed grills left, he is distraught! In a fit of desperation he steals Markie's mixed grill, and makes a run for it!

You play the role of Markie and have to chase him and get your mixed grill back!

### Introduction

I've been experimenting with _[SWIFT](SWIFT "wikilink")_ lately - having previously only written Beeb games in BBC BASIC back in the day, I thought it would be fun (in a kind of masochistic way) to try writing a game to get myself used to coding in assembler.

The result is a BBC Micro homage to Namco Bandai Games' eccentric WiiWare title _[Muscle March](wikipedia:Muscle_March "wikilink")_, a grey import of which proved particularly popular at _[Retrovision](http://www.retrovision.org.uk/) 2010_. As Markie, Retrovision organiser, in his full _Ming the Merciless_ TV animated character costume, you must chase and match the pose of Bane, AKA comic book supervillain Mixed Grill Man, as he tries to escape with your mixed grill, bashing his way through walls which have inexplicably been built in the way. At the end of each of four levels, the player must alternate key tapping rapidly to catch up and tackle the thief. The controls are A and Z to toggle your character's left hand, and \* and ? for your character's right hand.

#### Features

- Play as Markie, chasing Mixed Grill Man (aka Bane) to get your mixed grill back!

- Four levels, that gradually get harder as Markie goes along (from fairly tame, to hardcore)!

- Generic twelve bar blues music! With arpeggios!

- MODE 7 title and instructions screen - with high score table!

- A bit where you hammer the keys to catch the mixed grill thief (with parallax scrolling (sort-of!), and smooth single-pixel-horizontal-scrolled road and houses :D)

- Hours of fun and frustration!

_A marvellous pastiche of the Wii's camp classic 'Muscle March', this isn't just a nod to some RV folklore; it's a meaty, twitchy challenge, worth tasting..._

##### Status

Total size is 73k of assembly source (!! - How on earth did people cope coding on a real beeb?), which assembles into about 4547 bytes of machine code (and 3482 bytes of gfx on top of that) - giving us space to spare :).

##### TODO list

Nothing, it's all done :) - although if I were looking for things to do the following enhancements would be nice, don't think they'll get done though:

- Joystick support

- Ability to turn off the potentially annoying music
