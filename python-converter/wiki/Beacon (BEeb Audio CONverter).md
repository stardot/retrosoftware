### Introduction

Beacon (abbreviated form of BEeb Audio CONverter) is a tool allowing you to convert WAV files for playback on the BBC.

This program is still a work in progress so you should use entirely at your own risk. As always I would appreciate any comments, suggestions for improvement or bug reports that anyone may have.
