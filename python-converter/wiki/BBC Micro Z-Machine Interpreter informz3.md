### Licence

Please see the individual components' websites, as they are separately licensed. The Inform / Z-Machine v1.1 (Infocom v3) Development Environment consists of:

[BBC Micro Z-Machine v1.1 (Infocom v3) Interpreter](BBC_Micro_Z-Machine_Interpreter "wikilink") by Jon Welch

[BeebEm for Windows](http://www.mikebuk.dsl.pipex.com/beebem/) maintained by Mike Wyatt

[Inform](http://www.inform-fiction.org/) 6.15 by Graham Nelson

### Getting Started

- Download the development environment archive below.

- Unzip the archive to a folder on your computer.

- Use your preferred text editor (or [an IF Editor](http://www.firthworks.com/roger/editors/index.html)) to view the source code of the sample v3 Inform 6.15 game, `MyGame1.inf`.

- At a command prompt, run the sample batch file `MyGame1.bat` to automatically compile the Inform 6.15 source code, wrap it into a BBC Micro disk image and run the emulator & Z-Machine Interpreter with the resulting v3 Z-code file.

Now you can start building your own game! You can make a start by reading the _Inform Beginner's Guide_, as well as the _Inform Designer's Manual_ 3rd and 4th edition which are supplied in the docs folder. Roger Firth's [Inform 6: FAQ](http://www.firthworks.com/roger/informfaq/index.html) also contains lots of useful information.

For support developing your game with the _Inform 6.15_ language, the community at [rec.arts.int-fiction](nntp://rec.arts.int-fiction/) should be your first port of call. If you're having difficulty or have found any issues with the _BeebEm_ emulator, the _BBC Micro Z-Machine Interpreter_ or any other part of the _Inform / Z-Machine v1.1 (Infocom v3) Development Environment_, post to the _Retro Software_ forum:
