### Licence

Please see the individual components' websites, as they are separately licensed. The Inform / Z-Machine v1.1 (Infocom v3) Development Environment consists of:

[BBC Micro Z-Machine v1.1 (Infocom v3) Interpreter](BBC_Micro_Z-Machine_Interpreter "wikilink") by Jon Welch
[BeebEm for Windows](http://www.mikebuk.dsl.pipex.com/beebem/) maintained by Mike Wyatt
[Inform](http://www.inform-fiction.org/) 6.15 by Graham Nelson

### Getting Started

-   Download the development environment archive below.
-   Unzip the archive to a folder on your computer.
-   Use your preferred text editor (or [an IF Editor](http://www.firthworks.com/roger/editors/index.html)) to view the source code of the sample v3 Inform 6.15 game, `MyGame1.inf`.
-   At a command prompt, run the sample batch file `MyGame1.bat` to automatically compile the Inform 6.15 source code, wrap it into a BBC Micro disk image and run the emulator & Z-Machine Interpreter with the resulting v3 Z-code file.

Now you can start building your own game! You can make a start by reading the *Inform Beginner's Guide*, as well as the *Inform Designer's Manual* 3rd and 4th edition which are supplied in the docs folder. Roger Firth's [Inform 6: FAQ](http://www.firthworks.com/roger/informfaq/index.html) also contains lots of useful information.

For support developing your game with the *Inform 6.15* language, the community at [rec.arts.int-fiction](nntp://rec.arts.int-fiction/) should be your first port of call.
