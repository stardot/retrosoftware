### Introduction

The budget-price platform game _[Joe Blade](wikipedia:Joe_Blade "wikilink")_ was originally released on the Spectrum. The game was also ported to the C64, CPC, Acorn Electron, BBC Micro, Atari 8-bit, MSX and Amiga ST by Player, based on an original idea from the Spectrum author, Colin Swinbourne.

Retro Software is therefore proud to reveal a brand new Atom port by the Dutch coder Kees van Oss. This new release is an astonishingly accurate version of the original title. The conversion was 'relative' easy because the resolution of the screen matches perfectly the Atom CLEAR4 resolution. Because it's a monochrome game, the graphics are exactly the same as the original BBC/Electron game. In the original game there were not many sound effects but they are also included in the Atom version.
