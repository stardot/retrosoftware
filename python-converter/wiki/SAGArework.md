### Licence

### Introduction

This project is a re-implementation of the engine for the *[Scott Adams](http://www.msadams.com/)* and *Mysterious Adventures* games, with the addition of the location graphics that were included with ports on other platforms. Even though the BBC Micro was short of memory and only had a limited colour palette it should still be possible to supply some graphics; even mode 7 ones!

The target platform is to run the games with the new engine on an unexpanded BBC Micro Model B with standard PAGE &1900 DFS to allow full saving.
