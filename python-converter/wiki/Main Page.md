_Posted: 2013-10-27 12:54_ |\*_Retro Software_' is both:

- a community dedicated to encouraging and supporting the development of brand new games for "retro" computing platforms

- a publishing label for Acorn micros - namely the _BBC Microcomputer_ range, the _Acorn Electron_, the _Acorn Atom_, the _Acorn Archimedes_ and the _Acorn RISC PC_.

We provide information on projects currently in development, a forum for programmers and gamers alike to gather opinion and ask questions, as well as a knowledge-base that experts can use to document coding principles, best practices etc. Also available are a number of tools for modern systems, which are intended to make it easier to develop software for such classic machines.

The first commercial release by **Retro Software** was _[ZAP!](Zap "wikilink")_ for the BBC Micro in May 2009. This was followed up in September 2009 by _[The Krystal Connection](The_Krystal_Connection "wikilink")_. These mid-range Blue Label titles were joined by our eagerly-awaited first premium White Label release, _[Repton: The Lost Realms](Repton:_The_Lost_Realms "wikilink")_ at R3PLAY in November 2010. _[Mountain Panic](Mountain_Panic "wikilink")_, our first wholly original title, was launched at Play Expo in October 2013. All four are available on floppy disc (incl. a free emulator image with each physical purchase) and supplied in a jewel case complete with colour inlay and printed labels.

Alongside these commercial titles, the **Retro Software** community has continued to produce a steady stream of quality freeware titles, available for download direct from this site. Some of our latest releases are linked above, but there are many more available from our [Releases](RetroReleases "wikilink") page.

Please note, **Retro Software** is and will always be a non-profit initiative and all revenue goes towards the cost of materials and promotion.
