### Licence

TBC

### Introduction

Revealed at Retro Fusion 08, a long-lost BBC Micro puzzler that evolved from _[Repton: The Lost Realms](Repton:_The_Lost_Realms "wikilink")_ but was never released.

Currently, only one levelset exists; however, as the layouts of four of the six screens are very similar to those contained within 'SET A' of _[Repton: The Lost Realms](Repton:_The_Lost_Realms "wikilink")_ these are to be discarded and instead, 22 brand new screens need to be designed from scratch.

Current status:

- BBC Micro code: COMPLETE

- Acorn Electron port: STARTED

- Level Design: YET TO BEGIN

- Cover Art: YET TO BEGIN

- Documentation: STARTED

Please note: this game is much more than just a 'themed' set of Repton levels, as there are significant changes in gameplay and character behaviour!
