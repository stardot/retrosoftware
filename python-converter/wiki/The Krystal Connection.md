### Introduction

Back in 1985/86, Stephen Smith came very close to completing a platform game for the BBC Micro called "The Krystal Connection", which was due to be published by Melbourne House (Stephen still has the original contract and correspondence between himself and Alfred Milgrom).

Stephen forwarded the latest version of the game to Retro Software and, despite the lack of source code, we have been able to address the remaining issues (e.g. implementation of a working password/level skip system, Master compatibility, plus various other fixes and cosmetic changes).

We have also been able to add custom cover art and loading screen, thanks to the talented [Kecske Bak](http://www.kecskebak.co.uk) (Dave Jeffery).

The game is 100% machine code, features in-game music and uses hi-resolution Mode 1 graphics.

It was released by Retro Software at [Acorn World 2009](http://www.acornworld.co.uk) on September 12th 2009 in Huddersfield, and is now available for purchase online.
