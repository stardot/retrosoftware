### Introduction

This is the "slightly-remastered" 1.1 version of *Farmyard Fun* as I found a few things that needed correcting, although I avoided any big changes. It was originally written in 1989.

The parser isn't what it should be but it is still playable. Here are some clues:

To enter/leave vehicles do: ENTER <name> or LEAVE <name> also DRIVE <direction> To buy things do BUY <name>

If you want to work with the coca-cola just refer to it as CAN

Remember to MILK COWS

There is money in the game, but not implemented in a sophisticated way.
