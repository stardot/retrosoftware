### Introduction

A proficient BASIC programmer from an early age, the author of _JSnake_ has been inspired to give assembly language programming a go to create a "homebrew" game after getting into retro computing over the last couple of years.

_JSnake_ is a simple Snake clone chosen as a good first project as it is one of the easiest games to code, rather than going for something too ambitious for an assembler beginner. _JSnake_ is intended to start off as a very simple game, and be expanded as the author learns.
