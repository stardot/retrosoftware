# Rich Tech 2 (engine name, eventual game title TBD) by Rich Talbot-Watkins

### Licence

Software licence TBC

### Introduction

Expected Features:

- Scrolling tech (a la Firetrack, but windowed, multi-directional)

- Map printing (for plotting new slivers of screen which have scrolled on)

- Sprite routines

- Sound / music engine, plus two tunes!

- Some nice demo-style animating wibbly text routines

- The screen centres around the player, so if the player jumps sideways, then the screen will move in an arc around him.
