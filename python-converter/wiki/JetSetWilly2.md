### Introduction

Jet Set Willy II is, comparing to the other ports, a new game instead of an expansion of the JSW map. Its map omits 60 new rooms, several of which are based on rumoured events in JSW that were in fact never programmed (such as being able to launch the titular ship in the screen called "The Yacht" and explore an island). In the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad and MSX versions Willy is blasted from the Rocket Room into space, and for these 33 rooms he dons a spacesuit. Jet Set Willy 2 is simple, addictive and downright fun. Quite startingly, considering the ubiquity of ports of the game to mobile phones, PCs and games consoles, this is probably the best version of Willy's adventures that you will ever play.

Retro Software is therefore proud to reveal a brand new Atom port by the Dutch coder Kees van Oss. This new release is an astonishingly accurate version of the original title. The conversion was 'relative' easy because the resolution of the screen matches perfectly the Atom CLEAR4 resolution. Because it's a monochrome game, the graphics are exactly the same as the original Electron game. In the original game there were not many sound effects but they are also included in the Atom version.
