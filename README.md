# retrosoftware.co.uk

Contents from the retrosoftware.co.uk site

This is a full export of the MediaWiki site from 18-09-2016.

## Aims

It would be great if we could convert the `XML` content to the Github wiki format.

If anyone has time, and PHP installed, perhaps they could take a look at: https://github.com/philipashlock/mediawiki-to-markdown

Alternatively, if there's a way to convert the WikiMedia content to a HTML site that would be a great option too, since we could host it using Github pages.

Another option - https://github.com/peterjc/mediawiki_to_git_md

Which is a python solution, that I tried to have a quick go at - https://github.com/stardot/retrosoftware.co.uk/tree/master/python-converter

The results are workable, but a lot of html/edge cases need weeding out - see the sample output here: https://github.com/stardot/retrosoftware.co.uk/tree/master/python-converter/wiki
