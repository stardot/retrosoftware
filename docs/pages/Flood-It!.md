### Introduction

This BBC BASIC port is the result of spending a frustrating period playing the fun colour puzzle game *Flood-It!* ([play online](http://cdn.labpixies.com/campaigns/flood/flood.html)) from Google's [LabPixies](http://www.labpixies.com/) on PC and iPod [iOS](http://www.labpixies.com/iphone/). Also available on [iGoogle](http://www.google.com/ig/directory?q=labpixies) and [Android](http://www.labpixies.com/android?id=10). It's a simple yet addictive strategy game in which you have to flood the whole game board with one colour in less than 21 steps. Try to flood-it in the least amount of steps!

A perfect example of thinking "This should be easy to implement on the BBC Micro". Press the number associated with the colour you want the squares to change colour to, starting at the top left corner. As the game is written in BBC BASIC it should work on other platforms with BBC BASIC - Archimedes, RISC PC, Iyonix, PC etc.

Many thanks to LabPixies for creating such an enjoyable game originally, and all the \*./STH forum members who contributed feedback, code and ideas to improve this port.
