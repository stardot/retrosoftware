# AUN/Ethernet IP Addresses

Rob will be running a VoIP router to provide incoming telephone lines to the BBS. As a consequence of this, we will have a 'clean' subnet available at the show, NATted to the hotels network, should anybody have machines with ethernet interfaces that wishes to connect in. Please bring your own cables, and a hub/switch preferably with at least two more ports than you need to use (to allow us to daisy-chain them).

There will be a DHCP range (currently set to 192.168.15.150 - 199) for any ad-hoc machines that do not care about their address.

Static addresses can be used in the 192.168.15.x range. Assume that any entries in the Econet table above are already reserved.

Internet is there if you need it, but don't hog it - it'll be mainly for incoming connections to the viewdata BBS and/or econet. Not for catching up on your downloads :-)

Gateway is 192.168.15.1. DNS, unknown, depends on hotels ISP, but I'm using 208.67.222.222 / 208.67.220.220 (OpenDNS) which will work.
