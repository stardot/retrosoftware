Project started. After quite some consideration the choice of either MODE 1 or MODE 2 was made with the decision to go with MODE 2. This was decided from several factors :

-   More colours
-   Can copy graphics fairly easily from other 8 bit versions with same resolution and pixel aspect ratio
-   Reasonably simple/quick sprite plotting routine comparing to maskable sprites in MODE 1

Several versions were looked at with the final decision to copy graphics etc. from the Commodore 64 version.

To give myself an early boost and to be able to show some early demo's decision made to write Sprite Plot routine first. Work on memory map and how to fit everything in still to be done.
