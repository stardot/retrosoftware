*Target Systems:* **BBC Microcomputer**
*Licence:* TBC
*Developed in:* BBC BASIC 6502 assembler
*Volunteer skills required:* **Level-set designer**, **8-bit graphic designer/artist** (both using the game's built-in editor)
A BBC Micro puzzler which, although there are significant changes in gameplay, is actually a derivative of Paras' original *Repton 4* game engine from 1988, which was itself eventually re-built from scratch by Retro Software and finally released as *[Repton: The Lost Realms](Repton:_The_Lost_Realms "wikilink")*. The game itself is pretty much complete, but only has a handful of levels, many of which are derived from (and therefore very similar to) the original *Repton 4* set of levels which were eventually published as the first set of *[Repton: The Lost Realms](Repton:_The_Lost_Realms "wikilink")*. To complete this title, one or more volunteers are needed to create four levelsets of six screens using the built-in level editor, preferably with a modified graphics set for each of the levelsets.

*Jeltron* was written in the early 80s by Richard 'tricky' Broadhurst and Gil Jaysmith, the author of Spectrum *Repton* 1 & 2, with graphics from one of Gil's friends. From the same vein as Irem's *[R-Type](wikipedia:R-Type "wikilink")* (1987), *Jelton* is a super-smooth simultaneous two player shoot-'em'up without flicker and a neat MODE split, that was developed as far as a preliminary demo version that was sent to a publisher for consideration. With Gil's permission, Richard has offered the game resources to Retro Software and has also offered to support anyone who might be willing to continue the project.

The second game for the BBC Micro worked on by Stephen, author of *[The Krystal Connection](The_Krystal_Connection "wikilink")*, was developed around 1988 and is a 2D/3D game with split screen modes inspired by *[Battlezone](wikipedia:Battlezone_(1980_video_game) "wikilink")* and titles from *[Ultimate: Play The Game](wikipedia:Ultimate_Play_the_Game "wikilink")*. The basic idea of the game is to complete missions which are played out on the surface of Uropa (ex-Europa), the re-built moon of Jupiter and within the colonist base stations (isometric). The game is not complete - there are a number of things Stephen has described that would be worth changing and he estimates it still requires quite a bit of work to complete, if anyone would like to take on the challenge?

Titled after the main protagonist, this is a modern revision of an abandoned platformer which was originally inspired by the simple and addictive gameplay of *Sega*'s *Teddy Boy* on the Master System. An early version, working title *Onslaught*, was rejected by *Superior Software* as it was too late in the BBC Micro's commercial life, despite the authors' belief that the game was genuinely fun to play and felt a little bit different in style and gameplay from anything else they'd played on the Beeb, with lots of moving characters, dot explosions, and plenty of action. A promising tie-in with *Acorn User* magazine also failed to materialise due to the chaotic nature of development, and the inevitable dropping of 8-bit support from the magazine. For five years, the game languished in an unfinished state in the Lost & Found archives of stairwaytohell.com but the author has now returned to it, with the hopes of polishing it off and finally giving it the release it deserves.

*Licence:* Non-Profit Commercial
*Developed in:* [Ophis](https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mcmartin/ophis/) 6502 assembler, ARM assembler
*Bomber Blaster* is a re-imagining of Hudson Soft's multi-player classic *[Bomberman](wikipedia:Bomberman "wikilink")* franchise on both the 8-bit BBC Micro and 32-bit Archimedes / RiscPC platforms and supports four and five players, respectively, using a combination of the keyboard and joysticks. The player must strategically place bombs to destroy opponents and remove obstacles. Exploding bombs can set off other bombs, destroy or injure opponents and blow up obstacles. However, they can also kill or injure your own character and destroy powerups. Powerups are plentiful amongst the maze-based levels and the player's goal is to be the last man standing, who is the winner. The current graphics have been temporarily extracted and modified from the game *Dynablaster*, on either the Amiga or Atari ST. They are intended to be replaced by wholly original resources before release.

At the homebrew coding weekend which was part of the In Da 80s event in Manchester (16th - 17th July 2011), visitors were invited to submit ideas for an 8-bit game which was to have four levels, each themed around a specific event in the retro gaming calendar from 2009-2010, *Byte Back*, *Console Combat*, *Retro Reunited* and *Replay*. Attendees were asked to come up with level designs based on their favourite show memories to feed into a game which is hoped will be developed by a team of volunteers in time to be initially showcased at *Replay 2011*.

A BBC micro conversion of [Treasure Island](wikipedia:Treasure_Island_(video_game) "wikilink"), a fairly simple maze game from 1985 by Greg Duddle originally supplied with the [Commodore Plus/4](wikipedia:Commodore_Plus/4 "wikilink"), and based on the [classic 1883 novel](wikipedia:Treasure_Island "wikilink") by [Robert Louis Stevenson](wikipedia:Robert_Louis_Stevenson "wikilink"). Played over an 8x8 grid of flip-screens, the aim is to explore the island, as Jim Hawkins, to find the treasure, collect certain items, and deal with any pirates that get in your way. Once you've found the treasure you must race back to the Hispaniola before Long John Silver catches up with you.

*Xavier Tardy's Highly Optimized Pure Arm Code Shoot'Them Up for the Archimedes Range of Computers* is a vertical shoot-'em-up. It works perfectly on an A3010, 50 frames per second with huge sprites, as if the machine was a Neo Geo. The plotting and unplotting routines are just perfect in terms of CPU usage. The intention is to demonstrate the great possibilities of the Acorn Archimedes range and to show how many 2D games have been poorly programmed for these fantastic machines. The game should fit on a minimal number of floppy discs, and work on a 2 MB machine. A demo available for download shows off some of the tricks used in the development of the game.
