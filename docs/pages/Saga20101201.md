# 01/12/2010: Responses

![](./images/sagacmdsworking.png "fig:sagacmdsworking.png") It's been a while since I've updated; having been busy on other things. Anyway, I've implemented most of the responses and have been playing through *The Golden Baton* to try and find bugs.

There's still stuff to be done, but I guess I've implemented about 90% of the interpreter and it plays through most of *The Golden Baton*, my bug list looks something like:

-   GET ROPE (when hanging) requires repeating (continued)
-   No "Don't understand if nothing actioned"
-   LOOK over-ride
-   Unimplemented:
    -   continue
    -   put item
    -   print counter
    -   swaploc1
    -   sel counter
    -   refill lamp
    -   light and dark flags
    -   light lifetime
    -   quit
    -   load
-   Tune and clean up source

In terms of file sizes, my code stands at &B03 bytes, which include the system messages, which I'm playing to load externally. This added to the size of the compressed game file for TGB (&11E8) is &1CEB. Comparing this against the original size that was released (&3148) and I've reduced the size to about 55%.

But, there's always a sting in the tail: my dreams of getting some games to work with MODE 0/1/2 is turning out to be a pipedream. With PAGE at &1900, this means that the code plus the game will go up to &35EB, which is quite scary as TGB is one of the smallest games. I have some space below &E00 that I can use (pages 4, 7, 8, 9, A, B - I've already allocated 5, 6 and C) and I could potentially lower PAGE to &1400 if I'm careful about the use of disc, but this has to cover the code I haven't yet written (including graphics code) and only for small games.

So it's time to make the design decision: I'm going to go for mode 4 or 5 for graphics. I could possible make an exception if I'm know the game is running on a Master/B+/E00 DFS which would give me an extra 10 pages; or, if I was running from ROM. More to think about!

I should be happy though - I've implemented a SAGA interpreted in a tad under 3K in a machine code that I haven't used for 20 years, and even then I only used it to write cheats for games!

Lessons over the past few days:

-   Check out your zero page allocations carefully; I nearly came to a halt as I was trying to squeeze too much into 10 bytes of zero page, when I actually over half of it unused!
-   Set up your OSFILE/OSWORD blocks in advance instead of creating them on the fly - it takes up a lot less memory.
-   Don't set up your wireless encryption key with lots of swearing in it as it'll be embarrassing when your better half asks for it!
