# 17/12/2010: More additions and code reduction

This covers the past few days where I've being doing dribs and drabs when I have had time. First off, some new stuff. I added a pseudo-random number generator as just grabbing a value from &FE44 didn't turn out to be random (interestingly enough Brian Howarth's code just gets the low byte of the system clock for this). I also added the print counter routine, one vital step on getting SCORE working properly.

The other area of work was code reduction, which I saved some notes on byte reductions. The first step was turning JSR xyz:RTS into JMP xyz; this saved about 5 bytes. Next I added a couple of functions to perform 16-bit addition to the most commonly used pointers. Some moving pointers around so I could could use common code also saved some bytes. Finally I found a whole chunk of code that I had duplicated, so this went.

The final savings were around 56 bytes, with details shown below:

| Code Size | Method                                         |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------|
| C7F       | Start                                          |
| C6C       | Adding addtobufptr                             |
| C63       | Moving some foundptr references to bufptr      |
| C5F       | Remove copying of noun to roomptr              |
| C5a       | Adding addtofoundptr                           |
| C51       | Adding copybptofp (copying bufptr to foundptr) |
| C44       | Removing duplicate code                        |

Because I'm using two pointers (bufptr and foundptr) I have a duplication of code which I should probably try and remove:

    .skipstringbp
    {
                   ldy #0
                   lda (bufptr),y
                   jmp addtobufptr
    }

    ; simple routine to add A to bufptr and save a few bytes
    .addtobufptr
    {
                   clc
                   adc bufptr
                   sta bufptr
                   bcc nooverflow
                   inc bufptr+1
    .nooverflow    rts
    }

This could save another 17 bytes; I need to think it out better though...

Edit: As I posted this, I realised that I can remove the jmp statement as the code will fall through anyway. So another 6 bytes down - size at the moment is &C3E; with about &200 of this being the system engine messages.
