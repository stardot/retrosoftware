### Introduction

-   *!! Amazing Music !!*

*Nyan SID* is a BBC Micro *Acornsoft*-style arcade game inspired by CRTC's *[beebnyan](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=57734)* demo, a BBC Micro implementation of the *[Nyan Cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyan_Cat)* internet meme. Uploaded in April 2011, the original [*Nyan Cat* YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH2-TGUlwu4) merged a Japanese pop song with an animated cartoon cat that has the body of a [Pop-Tart](wikipedia:Pop-Tarts "wikilink"), flying through space and leaving a rainbow trail behind it. The video ranked at number 5 on the list of most viewed YouTube videos in 2011 and has received over 70 million views in total.

After seeing a link to the *beebnyan* demo [posted to the STH forums](http://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=4500) and sirmorris' [light-hearted request for a *BeebSID* version](http://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?p=40119#p40119), resident *BeebSID* software expert Pitfall Jones applied some lateral thinking and saw the potential for a new BBC Micro MODE 2 project.

The result is a simple but highly addictive game that sees you control Nyan Cat, the Pop Tart Cat, travelling through space in a bid to last as long as possible. Nyan Cat's energy slowly depletes throughout the journey, but collecting a Good Green Star will boost it. The Bad Red Stars should be avoided as they suck energy from Nyan Cat, whilst Neutral White Stars have no effect.

When Nyan Cat is out of energy the game ends. The time you have survived is your score.

*Nyan SID* fully supports the *[BeebSID](BeebSID "wikilink")* add-on and, if one is connected, will run with an optional enhanced SID soundtrack. It was first publicly revealed at the 17th [Wakefield Acorn & RISC OS Computer Show](http://www.wakefieldshow.org.uk/) on Saturday, 28th April 2012, and released on Sunday 29th April.
