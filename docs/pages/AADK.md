### Introduction

An arcade adventure is a graphics fantasy game revolving around a single hero (man, woman, wizard, robot etc.) controlled by you the player. You explore an imaginary world by astute use of ladders and platforms, wandering through various locations collecting mystery artifacts and avoiding deadly foes.

*The Arcade Adventure Design Kit* is an exciting new suite of programs which allows you to create your very own graphics fantasy adventure land packed full with illustrated locations, fiendish puzzles and devilish foes. It's a comprehensive games designer and is the ultimate in do-it-yourself adventures. It's also fun. It comes with a complete example adventure: [Castle Blacknight](AADK#Complete_Example_Adventure:_Castle_Blacknight "wikilink").

It's for almost the complete family of Acorn machines: Electron, BBC B, B+, Master and Archimedes. Including modern RISC OS machines and BBC emulators. Size and complexity of adventures is only limited by the memory and speed of your machine. And of course your imagination! You don't have to be a programmer but you should have knowledge of your machine's BBC BASIC graphics up to User Guide level. Even if you know just a little bit about programming then you can add your own touches to enhance your finished game.

Powerful tools are at your fingertips. Create bricks and monsters with CHARACTER EDITOR. Put them together with the STRING EDITOR and then use the ROOM EDITOR to design the layout of the locations. With the OBJECT EDITOR you can choose the puzzles and animated foes that go in them. Then you can use the COMPILER which takes your designed elements and produces a complete, standalone BASIC game to your specifications.

It is hoped that as the user-base grows, Arcade Adventurers across the globe will be able to contribute to libraries of graphics, share hints and tips on design, and maybe exchange their adventures with each other. Prepare yourself for hours of fun and creativity!
