### Introduction

As a kid, I was proficient in BASIC on the Beeb, but never really got to grips with 6502 assembler. Since getting into retro computing in the last couple of years, I've seen a lot of "homebrew" games on many platforms (not least those on RetroSoftware) and have been inspired enough to have a go myself. I've started learning 6502 assembler, and picked a simple Snake clone as my first project. I believe Snake is the easiest game to code, and is therefore the best place to start, rather than going for the something that's too ambitious for an assembler beginner. *JSnake* will start off as a very simple game, and will hopefully be expanded as I learn.
