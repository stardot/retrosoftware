### Diary

### 1/11/08

After a two month total computer break decided to resume my beeb programming hobby and finish a game in time for Byte Back 2009. As Two Towers will take much longer to finish decide to complete an old project called Rocket Attack. Main plan is to get a 5 or 6 level game which is similar to Rocket Raid then add more features and better graphics

### 2/11/08

Sunday morning 9.30, fiancé watching holly oaks, so decide to take old Rocket Attack code apart. Get rid of any code witch I don’t want or could be done better and generally get everything in order and allot memory management list.

What’s in place?

1. Horizontal hardware scrolling to the left. 2. Player spaceship can be move anywhere within the screen boundary’s 3. Scrolling star field which detects and moves behind any objects or scenery 4. Basic scenery plotting routine which plots the scenery/land from the left and then scrolled.

What’s next?

1. Reprogram the land plotter so it will plot game objects such as fuel dumps and rockets.

### 3/11/08

1. Reprogrammed top and bottom land generator for speed and incorporated some blue finishing edges.

What’s next?

1. I will now improve the solid single color land to give a more rugged/rock effect.

`   This may take a couple of days as I will have to experiment with some techniques and I have a bonfire night to attend Tuesday evening.`

### 7/11/08

Still experimenting with some cavern generation techniques

### 11/11/08

Reprogrammed my main sprite routine so it can handle any size of sprite. The routine needs to be optimized for increased speed. Redesigned my main Rocket sprite, made it larger and more in keeping with the old rocket raid rocket sprite. As you can see by the latest video, there is much flicker. This is mainly due to timings and can be eliminated with fine tuning later.

I have worked on the land plotter routine, but results are too slow.

Stay tuned!

### 14/11/08

Ok!

Completely reprogrammed land plotter routine.

The screen background is made up of tiles. ( Change of approach LOL )So it is now possible to create detailed backgrounds similar to Fire Tracks. The video above shows it in action but only with one single tile. The scroll routine (land plotter) and main sprite print routine (Rocket) which can handle any size of sprite have been optimised for speed, hence no flicker.

Next task is to design some scenery (land) tiles and a create game stage/sector.

### 14/11/08

Added a better screen shot and demo, the other one was naff. This is the sort of look im going for.
