### Introduction

*The gaslamps are burning ...*

Written using *[The Quill](wikipedia:The_Quill "wikilink")* Adventure Writing System, this text adventure is set in the Victorian era and, although reasonably short, has been designed to be quite description-and-immersion rich with a few nice puzzles. There aren't so many new adventures coming along for the Electron these days and I haven't found any set in that period or of the Jack the Ripper / Sherlock Holmes ilk, so I thought I'd write my own after being inspired by the excellent BBC series *[Ripper Street](wikipedia:Ripper_Street "wikilink")*.
